# customer-segmentation

Any business is heavily reliant on its customers and its important to keep them happy and satisfied. So it is as equally important to also know what are their needs, how much are their needs and when do they need. 

In business it is also important to know your target audience clearly to have a perfect understanding of the supply design your business needs. By knowing the target audience, it helps us determine where to focus more to sell the product and also helps increase sales as we, now are selling the product to a whole buying group instead of individual customers.

The above two can be done by using Data mining clustering algorithms on the customer database to identify the target audience and increase sales in the business.
